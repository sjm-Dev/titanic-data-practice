# Titanic Project: Survival Analysis and Prediction

## Project Motivation
I have always been curious and passionate about data, uncovering hidden patterns, and studying results. For this reason, this Titanic project marked the beginning of my journey into the world of Machine Learning, and it was also my first step after transitioning from my 8 years of programming in C/C++ at university.

Through this project, I developed key skills such as:
- Handling missing data.
- Feature engineering.
- Creating visualizations to uncover patterns.
- Exploring classification models to predict survival probabilities.
